# Platform-Specific Scaffold (Code Structure)

This file documents the scaffolded code structure for the current project cycle.

## Example Structure

- `/playground/` — UI and visualization components
- `/artifacts/` — Output artifacts (architecture, workflow, documentation)
- `checklistSystem.js` — Checklist logic
- `agentRegistry.js` — Agent definitions
- `agentBus.js` — Agent communication
- `commands.js` — Command handlers

This file should be updated by the Blueprint Designer and Project Manager as the codebase evolves.
