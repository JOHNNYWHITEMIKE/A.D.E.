This is a placeholder for the interactive checklist tracker. The dashboard.html UI currently displays checklist progress. In a full implementation, this would allow agents and users to update checklist status in real time.

- [ ] Add UI for marking checklist items complete/incomplete
- [ ] Sync checklist state with backend/agents
- [ ] Display agent activity logs
