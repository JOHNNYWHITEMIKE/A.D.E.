# Inter-Agent Communication Interface

This is a placeholder for the inter-agent communication interface. In a full implementation, this would be a real-time message board or event log showing agent status, actions, and notifications.

- [ ] Add UI for agent messages and events
- [ ] Integrate with AgentBus for live updates
- [ ] Support filtering by agent, phase, or event type

For now, use this file to outline requirements and ideas for agent communication.
