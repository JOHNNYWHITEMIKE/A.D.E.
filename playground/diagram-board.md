# Collaborative Diagram Board (BPMN/UML Playground)

This is a placeholder for the collaborative diagram board. In a full implementation, this would be a web-based canvas for BPMN/UML diagrams, supporting real-time collaboration and export.

- [ ] Integrate a JS diagramming library (e.g., JointJS, Mermaid, or Draw.io Embed)
- [ ] Enable agent-driven updates and annotations
- [ ] Support export to SVG/PNG and code

For now, use this file to sketch diagram requirements and ideas.
